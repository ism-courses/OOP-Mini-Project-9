The company wants you to implement method inheritance for a Professor class defined in this repository.

Here are steps:
1. Define a **ISMProfessor** class.
2. The **ISMProfessor** class should be a subclass of the **Professor** class. 
3. Define a **greet_students()** method in the **ISMProfessor** class. The body of the **greet_students()** method should have two lines:
   a. A call to the **print()** function to print the text `"Hi everyone! It's a great day to study ISM 480!"`
   b. A call to the **greet_students()** method from the **Professor** (the superclass).
4. Create an instance of **ISMProfessor** and assign this instance to an object named **my_ism_professor**. You can pass any arguments for its attributes.
Call **greet_students()** method of **my_ism_professor** object.
