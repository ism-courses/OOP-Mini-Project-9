The Boss wants you to implement method inheritance for a Professor class defined in this repository.

Here are steps:
1. Define a **ScienceProfessor** class.
2. The **ScienceProfessor** class should be a subclass of the **Professor** class. 
3. Define a **greet_students()** method in the **ScienceProfessor** class.
4. The **greet_students()** method should print the string "Hi everyone! It's a great day to study Science!" and then it should call the **greet_students()** method from the **Professor** (more details to below).

5. Create an instance of **ScienceProfessor** and assign this instance to a variable named **my_science_professor**. You can pass any arguments for its attributes.
Call **greet_students()** method from **my_science_professor**.
